<h2>Background of Network Economics</h2>


<!-- ============================================================================================= -->

<table class="imgtable"><tbody>

<td align="left" colspan=2><p>
Wireless communication networks over time have evolved from a simple and small-scale system with the centralized
control into a highly complex and large-scale system, operated and maintained by various decentralized and self-interested network entities.
Along with this evolution, traditional network optimization technologies based on pure engineering considerations
often fail to get implemented, due to the lack of incentive to reconcile the conflict of interest (or competition) among various entities.
As a consequence, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive" target="blank">economic
incentive</a> emerges as an increasingly important issue in the network design and optimization.
At the same time, new emerging wireless access technologies and  network architectures, such as cognitive radio
networks and cellular-WiFi internetworks, usually require the cooperation of various network entities
(e.g., cooperative spectrum sharing between primary users and secondary users, and cooperative interconnection
between cellular networks and WiFi networks).
Promoting cooperation among various self-interested network entities also bring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive" target="blank">economic
incentive</a> issues to the fore.

<p>
My main research interests lie in the area of wireless communications and networking, in particular, the economic incentives in various
communication and network scenarios, including cooperative communications, cognitive radio networks, TV white space networks, cellular-WiFi internetworks, and
user-provided networks. My graduate and postdoctoral researches focus on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_economics" target="blank">network economics</a>,
mainly including the game-theoretic and economic modeling and analysis of communication network problems.

Nowadays we are witnessing an unprecedented worldwide growth of
mobile cellular data traffic, which is expected to reach 15.9 exabytes
per month by 2018, nearly an 11-fold increase over 2013.
However, traditional network expansion methods such as acquiring more spectrum licenses,
deploying new macrocells of small size, and upgrading access technologies are costly and time-consuming.
Clearly, cellular network operators need to find novel methods to resolve the mismatch between demand and supply growth.
User-provided networking, also called <a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu/" target="blank">user-centric networking</a>,
appears as one of the attractive solutions, where mobile users act as hotspots (hosts)
providing internet connectivities for others (clients).
In this project, we study the economic incentive for host users to share their internet connections with client users.
We also study a more general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing" target="blank">crowd-soruced</a> mobile internet access model, where each user can act as host, relay, and client at the same time.

<h3><a name="Proj_6">6. Cellular-WiFi Inter-Networking (Mobile Data Offloading)</a></h3>
(Postdoctoral Research in CUHK, Hong Kong, March 2012 - Present)
<table class="imgtable"><tbody><tr><td>
<a href="./Lin_GAO_files/topics/topic-cellwifi.jpg"><img src="./Lin_GAO_files/topics/topic-cellwifi.jpg" alt="alt text" width="200px" ></a>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>
Cellular-WiFi inter-networking is another promising approach to alleviate the cellular network congestion problem.
A typical cellular-WiFi inter-networking scheme is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_data_offloading" target="blank">mobile data offloading</a>.
Simply speaking, mobile data offloading is the use of complementary
network technologies, such as WiFi and femtocell,
for delivering data traffic originally targeted for cellular networks.
The benefit of data offloading through WiFi networks
(also called WiFi offloading) has been studied and quantified using real
data traces in existing literature, and it is shown that in a typical urban
environment, WiFi can offload about 65% cellular traffic
and save 55% battery energy for mobile users.
This performance gain can be further enlarged with the use
of delaying transmission and the prediction of WiFi
availability.
However, the existing results focus only on the technical aspect
of WiFi offloading, without considering the economic incentive
for WiFi network operators to admit
cellular traffic.
This incentive issue is particularly important
for the scenario where WiFi networks are privately operated by
third-party entities, who are expected to be reluctant to admit
non-registered cellular traffic without proper incentives.
In this project, we study the necessary economic incentives that cellular network
operators need to provide for WiFi operators in order to encourage such a cooperative
data offloading.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_spaces_(radio)" target="blank">TV white space network</a> is one of
the most promising commercial realizations of dynamic
spectrum sharing and cognitive radio, where unlicensed white space devices (WSDs) explore and exploit
the unused or under-utilized broadcast television spectrum (called
TV white spaces) via a third-party white space geo-location database.
This database-driven network archecture, instead of sensing-based, has been supported by many spectrum regulatory bodies (e.g.,
FCC in the US and OFCOM in the UK), standardization organizations (e.g., IEEE and ECC), and major IT companies (e.g., Google, Microsoft, and SpectrumBridge).
The long-term success of such networks requires the coordination and cooperation of all involved parties, including spectrum licensees,
white space databases, secondary operators, and end-users, which form the White Space Ecosystem.
While most of the existing studies focused on the technical issues in deploying a database-driven white space database network, we consider in this project the economic
issue in operating such a network.
More specifically, we propose and analyze two different market models for this incentive issue: white space market and information market.

<a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_market">Futures market</a> and
<a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_market">Spot market</a>
are two of the widely-used and well-studied market forms in practice.
The futures market insures buyers against uncertainties of future supply through predefined contracts,
while the spot market allows buyers to compete for goods based on their real-time demands and preferences.
A <a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_market">hybrid market</a> combining the futures and spot markets has both the reliability of the futures market and the flexibility
of the spot market, and thus is highly non-trivial for quality of service (QoS) differentiations in dynamic spectrum
access.
Specifically, a mobile user with elastic services (e.g., file transferring) may be more interested in spot transactions
to achieve flexible resource-price tradeoff, while a mobile user with inelastic services requiring a minimum
data rate (e.g., video streaming and VoIP) may prefer the certainty of contract in the futures market.
In this project, we study the optimal trading mechanism
in a hybrid secondary spectrum market with a monopoly PU (seller) and multiple SUs (buyers).
We propose an integrated contract and auction design-ContrAuction, which achieves the optimal spectrum allocation
among spot market users with elastic application/demand and contract users with inelastic application/demand..

Radio spectrum is becoming more congested and scarce with the explosive development of wireless services and networks.
At the same time, however, many frequency bands are largely under-utilized by their legal licensees (e.g., the
average spectrum occupancy is less than 25% in the UHF/VHF licensed for broadcast television service).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_radio" target="blank">Cognitive radio</a> emerges as a promising paradigm to improve spectrum efficiency
and alleviate spectrum scarcity, by allowing unlicensed secondary users access the licensed spectrum opportunistically.
The successful deployment of cognitive radio networks requires economic incentives both for primary users (PUs) to open their licensed spectrum for secondary
sharing, and for secondary users (SUs) to utilize the new spectrum opportunities after
considering potential costs.
Cooperative spectrum sharing is a promising approach to address these incentive issues through the cooperation of PUs and SUs.
The key idea is to offer incentives for both PUs and SUs using the resource exchange between PUs and SUs, that is, SUs relay traffics for PUs (with their limited power)
in exchange for the access time on PUs' spectrum.

Market-driven <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_spectrum_management" target="blank">dynamic spectrum access</a>, also called dynamic spectrum
trading or secondary spectrum market, is one of the most promising approaches to address the incentive issues in cognitive radio networks.
With dynamic spectrum trading, PUs temporarily lease the under-utilized spectrum to SUs for additional profits.
Thus, with a proper design of the trading machanism, PUs have the incentive to open their licensed spectrum for secondary sharing, and SUs also have the incentive to utilize the new
spectrum opportunities.
In this project, we study dynamic spectrum trading mechanisms under different market scenarios.

Radio spectrum is the single most important resource in wireless communications, yet it is a limited and scarce
resource. Thus, spectrum efficient utilization is an important issue in wireless networks. This issue is particularly
important and challenging in decentralized networks with open sharing protocols (e.g., 802.11 WLAN and cognitive radio networks), where self-interested
mobile devices compete for spectrum openly. In such networks, proper
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive" target="blank">economic incentive</a> is necessary
to reconcile the competing interests among various devices, and further to avoid the free-rider problem.
In this project, we focus on the game-theoretic modeling and analysis of dynamic spectrum open sharing
under different network scenarios.
